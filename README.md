# ML-Pipeline-for-Fraud-Detection-and-Human-Activity-Recognition
This project implements a complete ML pipeline for two real-world classification tasks: detecting credit card fraud (binary classification) and recognizing human activities from sensor data (multi-class classification). It includes preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, model training, and evaluation.
